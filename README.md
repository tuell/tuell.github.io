# Inequality Top Flops 
## A datadriven card game

This game is the result of a hackathon of Deutsche Welle and BBC in June 2018. Based on the premise of visualising inequalities in the world with a DDJ-approach, our team developped the idea of a card game that let's you compare inequalities between different countries.

### The Game

"Inequality Top Flops" is a card game about different categories of inequality. It is played like "Super Trumps" (aka "Quartett" in German): The cards show different categories of ineqalities for a specific country. Players compete by choosing categories and comparing values. This example lets the user play against the computer. The goal ist to make players engage themselves more in the topic of inequality and to make them learn about the differences in a more sustainable way.

### The Cards

Each card lists the statistics for one country in seven categories:

üë£ Carbon emissions per person in tons
üçº Price of 1 liter of milk in US dollars
ü§ê Freedom of Press Rank according to Reporters Without Borders
üñ•Ô∏è Percentage of people with internet access
‚ò†Ô∏è Life expectancy
üó≥Ô∏è Year in which women got equal voting rights

### The data

The data for the cards was collected from multiple sources.

Milk price: https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/prices_by_city.jsp?displayCurrency=USD 
Women‚Äôs suffrage: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_suffrage#Timeline 
Life expectancy: http://apps.who.int/gho/data/view.main.HALEXv?lang=en 
Freedom of the press: https://rsf.org/en/ranking 
Internet users: http://www.internetlivestats.com/internet-users-by-country/ 
Carbon footprint: http://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/overview.php?v=CO2ts_pc1990-2013 

### Roadmap

Since this is a private project, there are no specific plans for further development. Possibilities include incorporating a rule book on the test page, adding information about the data sources and additional information on the different categories and possibly even information on how to engage in fighting these inequalities.

### The Team

This idea was created by journalists and software developers from Germany and Sweden.
